This is a personal site for gathering all my professional links and log of works that I have been doing. I am currently working as an doctoral researcher at University of Eastern Finland. I have a background in forest sciences (MSc) and I am also finishing my studies at Aalto university (MEng).

Please see below the links for the entries I have added to the site. This site is an experiment on couple of things. 

1. It serves as an log of all the projects and works that I am part of
2. It works as homepage and professional portfolio. Please see the [link About me](about.md) section.
3. Experiment on building and hosting a website for free. This site has been built using Github pages with the defaul "Minima" theme. I have no previous experience on working with html and css so this gives some insight on how static sites are built.

Please check out below the stuff I have been up to!
