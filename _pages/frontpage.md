This is a personal site for gathering all my professional links and log of works that I have been doing. I am currently working as an doctoral researcher at University of Eastern Finland and I have a background in forest sciences (MSc). I am also finishing my studies at Aalto university (MEng).

My research intrests are related very broadly on vegetation mapping using different remote sensing methods and sensors ranging from individual laser pulse canopy interactions to countrywide mapping tasks.

This site is an experiment on couple of things:

1. It serves as an log of all the projects and works that I am part of
2. It works as homepage and professional portfolio. Please see the [About me](about.md) section.
3. Experiment on building and hosting a website for free. This site has been built using Github pages with the defaul "Minima" theme. I have no previous experience on working with html and css so this a study on that aswell.

Please check out below the stuff I have been up to!
