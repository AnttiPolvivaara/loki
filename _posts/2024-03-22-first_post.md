This is the **first post** in this site. It will focus on my master's thesis and the workflow around it.

#### Background
Initial proposal for my master's thesis came from my supervisor. We had an mutual agreement on the idea that the thesis project should be technical - and that it indeed was and a bit too ambitious maybe in hindsight. The project was further deepened by the fact that quite early on, partly due to covid, I had a rather straightforward idea of continuing to phd studies as I were not very optimistic about the environment I was graduating to. Idea thus was to write the thesis thus that it could be extended to scientific article that can be published and counts as the first article in my phd thesis.
